## âš¡ How to save and upload changes:

1. Make changes to your files (e.g., edit HTML, CSS, JS).

2. Check the current status (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

3. Stage the changed files for commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

4. Create a commit with a clear and short message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Short description of what was changed"
   ```

   âœ¨ Tip: Use past tense for commit messages, e.g.,  
   `"Added homepage"`, `"Fixed navigation links"`, `"Updated CSS styles"`

5. Push the changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```
